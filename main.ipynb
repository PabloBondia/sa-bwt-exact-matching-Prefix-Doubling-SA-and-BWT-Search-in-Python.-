    "## 1. Explain the **prefix-doubling method** for suffix array construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prefix doubling method is a deterministic algorithm for constructing the suffix array of a string by iteratively sorting suffixes according to the lexicographic order of progressively longer prefixes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with an array of integer ranks representing individual characters, the algorithm sorts suffix indices using rank pairs of the form `(rank_k[i], rank_k[i + 2^k] or −1)`, which encode the first `2^k` characters of each suffix; indices extending beyond the string boundary receive `−1` to preserve ordering. After each sorting stage, new compact ranks are assigned sequentially, increasing only when adjacent tuples differ, thereby reflecting the ordering of prefixes of length `2^(k+1)`. The doubling continues until every suffix acquires a distinct rank, where the sorted indices constitute the final suffix array. Correctness follows from the monotonic expansion of prefix comparisons, and the algorithm performs `O(log n)` iterations, each sorting `n` integer pairs, yielding a practical time complexity of `O(n log² n)` with comparison sorting or `O(n log n)` with radix sorting, using `O(n)` auxiliary space.\n",

    "## 2. Testing Correctness of Suffix Array Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe how you tested your suffix array implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explain your tests:**  \n",
    "  - Use small example strings (e.g., `\"banana\"`, `\"abracadabra\"`) where the correct suffix array is known.  \n",
    "  - Compare your output against Python’s `sorted()` applied to all suffixes for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explain your confidence:**  \n",
    "  - If your implementation matches expected results for all test cases, argue why you believe it is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Experimental Evaluation of Running Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Design experiments to measure the **running time** of your method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare your efficient suffix array construction with the **naive O(n² log n)** method from the mandatory project.\n",
    "- Include:\n",
    "  - **Best-case** inputs (e.g., strings with many repeated prefixes)\n",
    "  - **Worst-case** inputs (e.g., random or diverse characters)\n",
